# capstone_project
These files are the code for Greg Muir's data science capstone project.

The dataset generation occurred using Dataset_Generation.ipynb. The API license is no longer active, so the full code won't run.
The files needed to run Dataset_Generation.ipynb are truall.csv and trulow.csv. These are inventory spreadsheets from Diamond Comic Distributors.
The generated datasets were saved via pickle as dfall.p and dflow.p

The analysis occurred using Capstone_Analysis.ipynb. The needed files are dfall.p and dflow.p.
